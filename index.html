      Hello, my name is Ardiansyah. I write code for profit and sometimes just for fun. 
      I’m happy to learn something new, especially in software development field, my favourite topics are development experience and productivity, system performance, and system scalability. 
      I mostly work on back-end environment, but sometimes I work on front-end as well especially on my freelance project. 
      I also work on AI/ML project, I know the concept but I’m just a tools user, not really AI/ML researcher. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In free time sometimes I write on <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@ard333" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a>, 
      push few code to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ard333" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github</a>, 
      or to <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/ard333" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitlab</a> for my personal project. 
      I also interested in management and culture, especially in remote work environment. 
      I save my resources related to remote work in <a href="https://remotework.fyi"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remotework.FYI</a>, you can also share your resources there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than those technical fields, I'm very interested in anything related to sustainable living, like permaculture, zero waste, renewable energy, and simple living. 
      I also interested in parenting, specifically about unschooling.
